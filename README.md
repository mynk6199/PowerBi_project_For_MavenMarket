# Maven Market Course Project - Power BI Sales Analysis Dashboard
## Overview
This repository contains the Power BI project for the Maven Market Course, showcasing a comprehensive sales analysis dashboard. The dashboard incorporates data from various CSV files related to customers, products, stores, regions, calendar, returns, and transactions. The project is structured into four parts, guiding you through data connection and shaping, data modeling, DAX measure creation, and finally, building the report.

### Part 1: Connecting & Shaping the Data
Follow the detailed steps in Part 1 to connect and shape the data from Maven Market CSV files. Ensure accurate data types, create calculated columns, and organize the data for effective analysis. Save the Power BI file as "MavenMarket_Report.pbix."

### Part 2: Creating the Data Model
In Part 2, set up the data model by connecting tables using valid primary/foreign keys. Organize tables in the MODEL view, hide unnecessary fields, and format date and currency values. Confirm relationships, cardinalities, and filter flows for seamless data analysis.

### Part 3: Adding DAX Measures
Enhance your report by adding calculated columns and measures using DAX expressions. These measures include various insights such as customer age, priority, profit calculations, and more. Validate these measures in the DATA view and spot check results.
